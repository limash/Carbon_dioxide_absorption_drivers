    "The coastal ocean is a biogeochemically active area that establishes a link between the atmosphere, the water column, and sediments.\n",
    "Thus, among others the local carbon cycling should be affected by some specific coastal area processes.\n",
    "Indeed, it has been proposed that some shelf areas act as a carbon pump absorbing atmospheric $\\text{CO}_2$ and transferring it into the ocean ([Tsunogai et al., 1999]; [Thomas et al., 2004]).\n",
    "Absorption capabilities are geographically dependent.\n",
    "It was reported that temperate coastal areas, in general, absorb $\\text{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere, while high and low latitude areas act as sources of $\\text{CO}_2$ ([Cai et al., 2006]).\n",
    "A $\\text{CO}_2$ atmosphere-seawater exchange is a function of difference between partial pressures ($\\text{pCO}_2$) of carbon dioxide in atmosphere and seawater.\n",
    "$\\text{pCO}_2$ in seawater depends mainly on temperature and biological activities ([Thomas et al., 2005]).\n",
    "Considering biological activities, on one side high productivity of coastal areas ([Gattuso et al., 1998]) enhance uptake of $\\text{CO}_2$, but on another, the degradation of additional organics coming from the land releases $\\text{CO}_2$ ([Bozec et al., 2006]).\n",
    "So, the net metabolism (autotrophy or heterotrophy) determines the $\\text{CO}_2$ uptake status of the specific area.\n",

    "The alkalinity determines the buffer capacity of sea water.\n",

    "The anaerobic degradation of organic matter (OM), which occurs mainly in sediments, generates total alkalinity (TA) ([Wolf-Gladrow et al., 2007]).\n",
    "The proximity of sediments and atmosphere and the large amount of OM available in the coastal area make it possible for anaerobic degradation in sediments to be an important process in $\\text{CO}_2$ exchange of the atmosphere with seawater.\n",

    "Authors explained the positive yearly input of TA from the Wadden Sea by alkalinity generation due to irreversible processes of denitrification (degassing of $\\text{N}_2$) and sulfate reduction (degassing of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ or burying of pyrite) in the Wadden Sea sediments.\n",

    "[Yakubov] according to total OM available for degradation in the Wadden Sea using a newly developed biogeochemical model calculated the range of TA fluxes through the Sediment-Water interface in the Wadden Sea and then estimated TA input from the Wadden Sea to the North Sea which was the same order with the previously published estimations of [Thomas et al.
