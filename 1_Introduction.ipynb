    "There are three central carbon dioxide seawater-atmosphere exchange controlling factors in the coastal area: alkalinity, temperature, and biological processes.\n",
    "The current study shows the importance of alkalinity generated in the coastal zone of the southern North Sea.\n",
    "This alkalinity reduces $\\text{CO}_2$ flux from seawater to the atmosphere in the southern North Sea approximately twice.\n",
    "High alkalinity preserves $\\text{CO}_2$ in surface seawater and can help “continental shelf pump” to store  $\\text{CO}_2$ on the larger time scales.\n",
    "Considering other $\\text{CO}_2$ absorption drivers in the southern North Sea, temperature effects dominate over the biological control at the annual scale, except the spring bloom."

    "The $\\text{CO}_2$ atmosphere-seawater exchange is a function of the difference between partial pressures of carbon dioxide ($\\text{pCO}_2$) in the atmosphere and seawater.\n",
    "Usually, $\\text{pCO}_2$ in seawater depends mainly on temperature and biological activities ([Thomas et al., 2005]).\n",
    "However, in the coastal area, alkalinity influence can be significant.\n",
    "Roughly, larger alkalinity values decrease seawater $\\text{pCO}_2$ causing $\\text{CO}_2$ absorption from the atmosphere, and there is high alkalinity measured in some coastal areas.\n",

    "One example of coastal systems with high alkalinity is the southern North Sea.\n",
    "According to the field data [Thomas et al. (2009)] proposed that the Wadden Sea (an intertidal zone along Dutch, German, and Danish coasts) is the main source of alkalinity to the southern North Sea.\n",
    "The authors suggested that the anaerobic organic matter (OM) degradation processes are the main alkalinity generators in the Wadden Sea.\n",
    "They proposed that degassing of $\\text{N}_2$ during denitrification and degassing of $\\text{H}_2\\text{S}$ or burying of pyrite during sulfate reduction cause a net alkalinity gain, which in turn causes a net $\\text{CO}_2$ uptake from the atmosphere.\n",
