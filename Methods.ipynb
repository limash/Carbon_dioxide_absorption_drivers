    "The Southern North Sea. Area of calculations = 1000x1000 m. Depth = 40 m. The sizes of the Wadden Sea and Southern Norht Sea are in Thomas (2009).\n",
    "1. The baseline scenario (with parameter values found previously for the Wadden Sea) with nutrients horizontal diffusive exchange (currently - horizontal scale = 1000m.; kz = 3.82 from Okubo(1971)).\n",
    "2. The scenario with TA and DIC fluxes from the Wadden Sea and TA, DIC, and nutrients horizontal diffusive exchange. TA and DIC fluxes are calculated due to TA and DIC concentrations in the Wadden Sea and normilized to the average values in the North Sea (baseline scenario). OR: The approximately minimum (and average) value of TA in the North Sea is 2300 mM. So it is a value with average amount of $NO_3$, $NH_4$, $SO_4$. Therefore minimum value of TA in the Wadden Sea should be equal to the average value of TA in the North Sea (an increase of alkalinity in the Wadden Sea is due to decreased $SO_4$ ions concentration).\n",
    "3. Similar to the second one, but with assuming the average values of TA in the Wadden Sea are bigger than in the North Sea (from picture in Thomas 2009 for example); it can be due to riverrine input, irreversible alkalinity generation due to denitrification and sulfate reduction, etc.\n",
    "4. Similar to the second one, but with only TA advective transport (without DIC).\n",
    "5. Add TA fluxes from the Southern North Sea sediments from Brenner (2016); and DIC probably."
